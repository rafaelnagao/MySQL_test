## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This database was created to practice the concepts and ways of creating database on MySQL Workbench. I'm still learning.

I created this database for training, it contains names of cities, states, mayors and companies. Databases are related to each other, both one-to-many and one-to-one relationships. The databases are incomplete, but if you want to help update and complete them, feel free. ü§ù

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### ‚õèÔ∏è Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>
This test was built using:


- Git v2.40.0.windows.1 [![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/GIT-E44C30?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE [![cypress](	https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-005C84?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)


### Installing
After installing all the applications described above, make a local clone of the project and branch to your repository, so that all changes will be saved correctly.

Access the directory where the repository will be cloned and type:

```
$ git init
```

This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâa Git repository skeleton.

You clone a repository with git clone <url>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called libgit2, you can do so like this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rafaelnagao/MySQL_test.git
```

or by SSH (if you already have a key configured)

```
$ git clone git@github.com:rafaelnagao/MySQL_test.git
```

Open your cloned local directory and enjoy!

## üîß Running the databases <a name = "databases"></a>
The databases are in the directory "~/MySQL_test/banco_relacional/"

I recommend opening the scripts within the MySQL framework, where they do not suffer conflicts.

### Break down into the databases
I created this database based on the JavaScript course I did on the Udemy platform, by Professor Leonardo Moura Leit√£o.

During my practice I made some "mistakes" (some purposeful, some not), such as duplicating data, including incorrect data, leaving incomplete data, etc. But some of these "bugs" are fixed later in the files titled "update".
